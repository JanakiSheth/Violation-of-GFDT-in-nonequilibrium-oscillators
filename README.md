# Violation-of-GFDT-in-nonequilibrium-oscillators
This is a MATLAB script to analyse the generalised fluctuation-dissipation theorem for nonequilibrium systems driven by adaptive forces, i.e. forces whose value depend upon their history. The work is published here https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.023150
