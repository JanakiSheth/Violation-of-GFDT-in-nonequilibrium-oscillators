# Violation-of-GFDT-in-nonequilibrium-oscillators
This is a MATLAB script to analyse the generalised fluctuation-dissipation theorem for nonequilibrium systems driven by adaptive forces, i.e. forces whose value depend upon their history. The manuscript for this project is currently under preparation and the preliminary version will be up on Arxiv soon.
